This is a program for analyzing potential returns for the PSE companies by using the most common method of using a MACD signal.

### CLICK THE "MACD auto calc" FILE FOR THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS

I didn't use all the public companies in the PSE as I don't know yet how to automate the downloading of historical data from ph.investing.

Steps for adding more companies:
  1. Download the historical data from ph.investing to keep a uniform format for all dataset. (Edit the program if needed when using a different format)
  2. Add the ticker symbol of the companies downloaded to the stock.txt file.

Now you can run the program.
