  This is my first project after learning how to program for about 3 months so expect a slow program, and most likely a lot of unecessary codes. This program is based on the book of Tobias E. Carlisle "Quantitative Value". I recommend you to read the book to understand the usage of the output of this program. Note that values scraped may be incorrect.

  This is a program that scrapes data from Morningstar and runs a quantitative analysis to companies that are listed in the txt. file. Currently it is set to get data from the PSE stock exchange. Sleep time can be changed depending on how fast your internet is. After running the program, a csv file will made in the same folder containing values.

HOW TO RUN:
1. Change the string in drvPath to the file path the folder currently is.
2. If your in a different market, go to any company in your market in Morningstar financials, copy everything after; including "&region" and change the all the code in the file.
3. Follow the format of companies in the txt. file.
4. Run the program.
